# About

## About Me
Welcome to my portfolio, my name is Scott Duong. I am a recent graduate from the University of Toronto where I studied Applied Statistics. This GitHub will be used to host my [side projects](https://github.com/jidafan?tab=repositories). I am interested in data analytics and aspire to become a data analyst in the future. I have experience in making dashboards using [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/scott.duong8287/vizzes) and PowerBI.

## Education
**Honours Bachelor of Science in Applied Statistics**\
2018 - 2023\

## Portfolio Projects

## **[COVID-19 Analysis and Visualization](https://github.com/jidafan/COVID-19-Analysis-and-Visualization)**

**Description**: The objective of this project is to analyze COVID-19 data sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases) on a local and global scale by using SQL to explore and examine the data, and Tableau to create a dashboard to visually present our findings.

**Code**: [See full SQL Code](https://github.com/jidafan/COVID-19-Analysis-and-Visualization/blob/main/Covid%20SQL%20Query.sql) and [See Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/scott.duong8287/viz/CovidTracking_16999254003760/CovidDashboard#1)

**Data**: To view the data, click [here](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases)

**Skills**: Data Exploration, Data Analysis, Data Visualization

**Tools used**: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), Excel, Tableau

## **[NBA MVP Prediction](https://github.com/jidafan/nba-prediction-mvp)**
